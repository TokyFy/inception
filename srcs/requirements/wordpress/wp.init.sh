Hey! Iâ€™m someone who loves figuring things out â€” mostly by getting them wrong first. 
I enjoy poking at everyday life like it's a mysterious puzzle boxâ€¦
except thereâ€™s no manual, and sometimes I realize Iâ€™m holding it upside down.

Iâ€™m into:

    *   Overthinking simple decisions like itâ€™s an Olympic sport

    *   Creating routines and then immediately rebelling against them

    *   Pretending to journal, but really just doodling and writing half-thoughts

    *   People-watching like Iâ€™m conducting a sociology experiment (with popcorn)

    *   Getting inspired by motivational quotesâ€¦ and forgetting them two minutes later

    *   I believe life is best learned through trial, error, and that awkward pause when you realize youâ€™ve been talking to yourself
in public. I enjoy learning by doing â€” and occasionally by not doing, then panicking, and finally doing it last minute.

This space is where I share things I notice, things I mess up, and things that make me laugh (especially when I probably shouldnâ€™t).
